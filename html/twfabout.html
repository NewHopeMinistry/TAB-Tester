        <h3>About The Twenty-First Century Version (TWF)</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        Work on the Twenty-First Century Version (TWF) of the Bible was begun in 2018, shortly after I experienced an extended stay in the hospital, where I saw God writing on the hospital room window with his finger. I feel very strongly that God called me to this work, and I am sure since I am an imperfect sinner, that my interpretation of the Scriptures will also be imperfect. The Holy Spirit is my guiding light in this endeavor, and has revealed to me that God wants a new scripture with a much softer and more forgiving tone than the traditional Scriptures. The foundation for the Twenty-First Century Version is the King James Version which was published in 1611. I have compared some verses that seem to be incomplete to me, to other more modern translations. Some of these more modern translations were translated from earlier Greek and Hebrew texts that were discovered after 1901. This is not a word for word Bible translation, it is my interpretation of what the Bible says, and a faithful interpretation of what the Holy Spirit is saying to me. I pray and try to analyze each verse  for what God is truly trying to say with the help of the Holy Spirit, then I rewrite it in such a way that I can understand it. It's a translation for me, and for you, if you want it. I use modern twenty-first century English grammar and I have tried to proplerly structure the sentences so that modern readers especially those with a college education understand what God's word says.
        <br><br>
        There are many verses in the older scriptures that seem to me to have incomplete information, leaving the reader with the need to fill in the blank. I have prayed over each of these verses and asked God to fill in the blanks for me. I feel he has done this to my understanding, but the Scriptures may be saying something entirely different to you. My whole entire life the Lord has given my heart a desire to leave this world a better place than it was when I arrived. I hope to one day hear "Well done, good and faithful servant."
        <br><br>
        I have done a lot of praying over The Twenty-First Century Version of the Bible! I want to thank you for your help God, and I pray this work is what you asked of me, and I pray it brings glory to your name!
