        <h2>Statement of Faith</h2><br>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <h4>Jesus Christ:</h4>
            We believe that Jesus Christ is God's Son, the second person of the Trinity, and he was God who came to earth as a man to bear our sin for us. He is the only man who ever lived a sinless life. He was born to a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross for all people, and atoned for our sins through the shedding of his blood. He rose from the dead on the third day, ascended to the right hand of our father, and he will return again in power and glory. The blood that Jesus Christ shed on the cross at Calvary was sinless and was sacrificed to cleanse people from all sin. Jesus allowed himself to be punished for our sins, enabling everyone that believes in him to be free from the penalty of sin, which is death. We believe our Lord Jesus Christ will return. When he returns, the dead in Christ will be the first to rise to meet the Lord in the air, then we who are alive will be called up into the clouds with them. We believe that the birth of the internet has given the word "cloud" a whole new meaning. After this, the seven year tribulation will take place on earth. Following the tribulation, Jesus will return as the king of kings and the lord of lords, and his believers will be with him.
            <br>
            <span class="cs-emphasis">See:</span> (1 John 1:7, 1 Timothy 2:5, 1 Timothy 3:16, Acts 1:11, Colossians 1:20, Isaiah 6:9-10, Isaiah 9:6, John 1:1, John 1:29, John 14, John 20:28, Matthew 13:11-17, Philippians 2:5, Philippians 6, Romans 3:10-12, Romans 5:9, Romans 23, Revelation 1:5, Revelation 5:9, Revelation 20:6, 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 1 Thessalonians 17)

            <h4>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</h4>
            We believe that baptism in the Holy Spirit is a free gift from God that is received by faith, and is the first step towards being born again in Christ. The Holy Spirit is received through faith which fills believers with the Spirit. We believe when someone is baptized in the Holy Spirit they also receive the ability to pray in other tongues and communicate with God through the Holy Spirit that lives within them. We also believe that Jesus commanded his followers to be baptized when he said in John 3:5, "Honestly, I tell you that unless you are reborn of water and the Spirit you can not enter into God's kingdom." Baptism by water is symbolic of having our sins washed away through Christ's blood sacrifice, crucifixion, death, burial, and resurrection.
            <br>
            <span class="cs-emphasis">See:</span> (1 Corinthians 14:2, Acts 1:8, Acts 2:4, Acts 19:1-7, Acts 8:36-39, Colossians 2:12, John 14:16, John 17, Matthew 3:11, Matthew 28:19, Romans 6:4, Romans 8:26-27)

            <h4>Born Again, Eternal Life, and Infinity</h4>
            We believe that Jesus said everyone must be born again in order to be saved, and once we are reborn we will inherit eternal life. We believe that anyone who physically dies without accepting and confessing Jesus Christ as Lord is hopelessly and eternally lost. We believe that Jesus spoke of the End of the Age in the book of Revelation which gives the words "forever" and "eternal" a whole new definition. We also believe that the Holy Spirit has given us a whole new understanding of the word "burn" through his revelations in 1 Corinthians 7:7-9 when Jesus said, "7: I wish everyone were like me, and they could get along without marrying. But we are not all the same, and God gives some the gift of a husband or wife, and he gives the gift of being happily unmarried to others. 8: So I say to the unmarried and the widowers, it is best to be as I am and stay unmarried if you can. 9: But if you can’t, go ahead and marry, because it is better to marry than to burn with lust."

            <h4>Divine Healing</h4>
            We believe God has the power to heal us through our faithful prayers, and also through the Spirit and sometimes through just the touch of our hands as his gift to those suffering in sin. Christ provided this for us when he made atonement for our sins on the cross, and it is available for every member of the body of Christ that beleives today.
            <br>
            <span class="cs-emphasis">See:</span> (1 Peter 2:24, Isaiah 53:4-5, James 5:14-25, Mark 16:18, Matthew 8:17)

            <h4>Man's Fall & Redemption</h4>
            We believe that man was created in the likeness of God. The world fell into sin through the sinful transgression of Eve and Adam, which resulted in death for all. God's son Jesus Christ was sent to sacrifice his life and shed his blood to redeem and restore man to God by providing us with salvation from our sin. Salvation is God's gift to man, which is separate from works and the law, and it is by grace through our faith in Jesus Christ that we are saved.
            <br>
            <span class="cs-emphasis">See:</span> (1 John 3:8, Ephesians 2:8, Romans 3:10, Romans 3:23, Romans 5:14)

            <h4>Sanctification:</h4>
            We believe that without holiness no one can see the Lord. We believe that sanctification begins when a person is first reborn in Christ which leads to a holy life, and continues as we grow in Christ throughout our entire life.
            <br>
            <span class="cs-emphasis">See:</span> (1 Corinthians 1:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, 2 Corinthians 3:18, 2 Peter 3:18, Hebrews 12:14, Philippians 3:12-14)

            <h4>The Bible:</h4>
            We believe the Bible is the inspired word of God, and it was written by holy men appointed by God who spoke and wrote what they were taught by the Holy Spirit. The New Testament is a new contract given to us from God, that brings salvation through his son Jesus Christ. We accept it as God's written guide that teaches us how to live our life, so that we can be with God in the next life. We believe that God has chosen some of us to be the devoted disciples of Jesus, and to teach his new contract to others.
            <br>
            <span class="cs-emphasis">See:</span> (1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 Peter 1:21, 2 Timothy 3:16, Luke 23:34)

            <h4>The Trinity:</h4>
            We believe our God is one spirit, equally manifested as three different persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God the father is greater than all, and his son Jesus, is the word made into flesh, and he is our heavenly father's only begotten son. We believe he has existed with the father from before the very beginning. The Holy Spirit is our helper, who comes from both the father and son to comfort, teach, and guide us. The Holy Spirit is our comforter, strengthener, advocate, intercessor, and will always stand with us.
